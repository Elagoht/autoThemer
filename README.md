<h2 id="0">What is autoThemer</h2>

This is a simple python script to change theme automatically by time. Designed for cinnamon. I created an interface to change system theme and you can set when the theme will change.

I prefer to use this program for setting dark/light theme.

<h2 id="1">Installation</h2>

Just run the appimage and set your config, then enable it. After that, if you think you never (or for a long time) change your configuration, you can safely delete app.

<h2 id="2">How It Works?</h2>

It creates a folder named _**".autoThemer"**_ in your home folder, to store your configurations and theme changer script.

After enable the program, it creates a desktop file on $HOME/.config/autostart.

If you remove all files from this application, you can delete them.
